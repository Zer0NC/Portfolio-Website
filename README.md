# ByZer0.de Portfolio Site

This repository contains the source code for the ByZer0.de portfolio website. The site serves as a platform to showcase personal projects, skills, and services with a modern and professional design.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the content of the website, including sections like home, about, projects, and contact.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the website, including the layout, typography, colors, and responsive design.
- **script.js**: Includes JavaScript for interactivity, animations, smooth scrolling, form handling, and other dynamic behaviors.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zer0NC/Portfolio-Website.git
   ```

2. Open the website locally by opening `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Customize the website by modifying the `HTML`, `CSS`, or `JavaScript` files to suit your personal needs.

4. Make sure to add your Discord Webhook in the script.js file at line 139.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be mobile-friendly and works seamlessly across various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Animations**: Smooth animations are implemented using GSAP and ScrollTrigger for an engaging user experience.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Projects can be filtered by categories such as "Web Development," "Discord Bots," and "Gaming."
- **Contact Form**: A contact form with form validation and submission through a Discord webhook.

## How It Works
